Verummeum is the creative website of Philip Vissenaekens. With Verummeum I want to provide interesting blog articles about software development, open-source projects and gaming. Most of these articles will have a focus on the Linux operating system. I hope you will enjoy the guides, reviews and opinion pieces about the latest developments in the software world. 

I also have an interest in digital art, photography and image editing, so I will also use Verummeum to share my visual creative work with you as well. 

Verummeum wants to encourage discussions amongst its visitors, so for this purpose a comment section is available under each post. 

Because Verummeum believes in open source, the complete source code and all posts of Verummeum are available on [Github](https://github.com/PhilipVis/Verummeum), free to be used under the [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).

## About me

I am Philip Vissenaekens, a software developer with an interest in open source, Linux and digital art. I started Verummeum in 2018, after I decided to move over completely to Linux. I had been running both Windows and Linux in a dual boot setup for a very long time, and had tested a number of different Linux distributions during that time. Because it took me a long time to make the transition to Linux, I decided to create Verummeum to help others with their transition of using proprietary software to open-source alternatives. 

Later on, I extended Verummeum to also be able to showcase some of my digital artwork.
