Are you interested in receiving Android notifications on your Linux desktop, or are you in need of an easy way to transfer data between Android and Linux devices? In this article we will take a look at [KDE Connect](https://community.kde.org/KDEConnect), a free and [open-source](https://github.com/KDE/kdeconnect-kde) project that allows you to easily set up communication between Android and Linux devices. 

<!--more-->
KDE Connect can wirelessly connect Linux and Android devices that are on the same Wi-Fi network. The devices need to be paired once, and will then be connected automatically when they are on the same network. The communication between the devices is encrypted and direct, there is no third-party service involved. 

Although "KDE" is part of the project's name, it doesn't need the KDE desktop environment to be installed. KDE Connect can be installed on all desktop environments. 

## What can KDE Connect do? 

Okay, KDE Connect allows communication between devices, but why is this useful? Let's take a look at the capabilities of KDE Connect!

## How to install

KDE Connect needs to be installed on all Android and Linux devices that you would like to sync. 

The KDE Connect package is available from the software repositories of most Linux distributions. This means it can be installed like any other application on your Linux device by using a software manager (or CLI commands). 

Alternatively, you can grab the source code for KDE connect from git and build it yourself, following [this guide](https://community.kde.org/KDEConnect#Building_KDE_Connect_.28Desktop.29).

The Android app can be installed from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kde.kdeconnect_tp) and the FOSS app store [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.kde.kdeconnect_tp/).
