In this article we'll take a look at a Linux distribution originating from China. The distribution is called [Deepin Linux](https://www.deepin.org) and it is based on Debian's unstable branch. The Linux distribution only has one desktop version, which includes their own unique Deepin desktop environment. 

The purpose of Deepin Linux is to provide an easy to use, reliable and beautiful desktop that meets the needs of most home users. Let's see if this Chinese distribution achieves its goals!

## Installation

When booting the installation media, you can choose to start the Deepin installation, to boot into failsafe mode or to check the media's integrity. 

When you choose the start the Deepin installation, the installation wizard loads. 

The installation itself took about 45 minutes on my older laptop.

## Documentation and Community

## Privacy

There are some privacy concerns surrounding Deepin. An example is [this forum topic](https://bbs.deepin.org/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=155293) on the Deepin forums which has more than 100 posts. As a result, the concerning tracking integration has been removed from Deepin as you can read [in this announcement](https://www.deepin.org/2018/07/20/statement-on-canceling-cnzz-statistics-in-the-deepin-app-store/). So Deepin does seem to listen to their users when privacy concerns are voiced, but they could avoid these concerns by not adding tracking features without telling their users in the first place. If you really have privacy concerns, you should probably avoid using Deepin.
