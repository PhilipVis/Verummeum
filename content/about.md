## About the author

The creator and author of Verummeum is Philip Vissenaekens, a software developer with an interest in open source and Linux. At the start of 2018, Philip decided to move over completely to Linux. Philip had been running both Windows and Linux in a dual boot setup for a very long time, and had tested a number of different Linux distributions during that time. Because it took Philip a long time to make this transition to Linux, he decided to create Verummeum to help others with their transition of using proprietary software to open source alternatives.
